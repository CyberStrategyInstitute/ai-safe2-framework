# Community Professional Standards

## 1. Our Commitment
The Cyber Strategy Institute is dedicated to providing a professional, collaborative, and high-performance environment for the AI SAFE² project. We are here to engineer certainty, solve complex security challenges, and build the industry standard for AI Governance.

We are committed to maintaining a community based on **professionalism, mutual respect, and technical merit**.

## 2. Expected Behavior
We expect all contributors and maintainers to:
*   **Focus on the Mission:** Keep discussions relevant to AI security, governance, and engineering.
*   **Treat Everyone with Dignity:** Engage with all community members professionally and respectfully, regardless of background.
*   **Debate the Code, Not the Person:** Technical disagreements are healthy; personal attacks are not.
*   **Lead by Example:** Maintain the highest standards of integrity and professional conduct.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior
To ensure the integrity of this project, the following behaviors are strictly prohibited:
*   Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind.
*   Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory comments.
*   Public or private harassment.
*   Publishing others' private information without explicit permission (doxing).
*   Any conduct that could be reasonably considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## 4. Enforcement
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards. In instances of unacceptable behavior, maintainers may take appropriate action, up to and including a permanent ban from the repository.

Instances of abusive behavior should be reported to `security@cyberstrategyinstitute.com`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated confidentially.
