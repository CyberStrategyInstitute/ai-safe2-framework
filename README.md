## 🚨 The Problem
AI Teams are scaling automation but leaving security behind. A single unsecured AI agent can expose sensitive client data, leading to catastrophic fines and reputation loss.

## 🛡️ What is AI SAFE²?
AI SAFE² is an open-source taxonomy and security protocol designed specifically for **Agentic AI**. Unlike traditional AppSec, this framework addresses the probabilistic nature of LLMs.

### The 5 Pillars
1. **Sanitize & Isolate:** Input validation and environmental isolation.
2. **Audit & Inventory:** Complete visibility and decision pathway tracking.
3. **Fail-Safe & Recovery:** Emergency protocols and circuit breakers.
4. **Engage & Monitor:** Human-in-the-loop oversight.
5. **Evolve & Educate:** Continuous improvement and adversarial hardening.

## 🚀 Getting Started
You can implement AI SAFE² manually using the documentation in this repository.

* [View Pillar 2: Audit & Inventory](/02-audit-inventory)
* [View Pillar 2: Fail-Safe & Recovery](/03-afaile-safe-inventory)
* [View Pillar 2: Engage & Monitor](/02-engage-inventory)
* [View Pillar 2: Evolve & Educate](/02-evolve-inventory)

## ⚡ Automate This (Agentic Shield)
Implementing this framework manually is a good start, but it doesn't scale.
**Agentic Shield** is our SaaS solution that automates the AI SAFE² protocol.
